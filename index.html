      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Our mission:</strong> To make every client feel confident,
        refreshed, and cared for through expert grooming and personalized hair
        services. Since 2015, we grew into a respected grooming destination in
        Angeles City, Pampanga, particularly known for its convenient location
        across Holy Angel University. Our salon is owned and operated by Charlie
        Domingo, a professional hairstylist with certifications and years of
        experience in the field. Our shop runs as a traditional and modern
        business, with all services performed in person. We do not sell through
        e-commerce platforms, but focus instead on building client
        relationships, maintaining professional standards, and creating a warm,
        family-like atmosphere inside our salon. Customer concerns or inquiries
        are mainly handled via our Facebook page, where people can view sample
        work, promotions, and send messages directly. This personal touch in
        operations paired with skillful services is what has made Charlie's
        Salon a local favorite over the past years.
